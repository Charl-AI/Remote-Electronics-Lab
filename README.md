# Remote-Electronics-Lab

This project is part of my summer 2020 undergraduate research opportunity program (UROP). The purpose of this project is to take an existing teaching lab from the
Mechanical Engineering course and to provide a compact, low-cost alternative that can be completed by students remotely.
