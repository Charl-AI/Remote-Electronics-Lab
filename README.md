# Remote-Electronics-Lab

Electronics teaching labs aim to give students a way to understand topics such as analogue filters through a hands-on experience. These labs typically require around Â£ 1000 worth of equipment such as function generators and oscilloscopes; this equipment is not available to students studying remotely due to coronavirus restrictions, so it is important to develop a low-cost way for students to complete the lab remotely. This project is part of my summer 2020 undergraduate research opportunity program (UROP) and develops a way to use an Arduino UNO for this purpose.

The final code can be uploaded to an Arduino and allows the board to act as both a function generator and an oscilloscope, which can be used with simple analogue filter circuits to complete the lab exercises. The generator can make sine waves from 2-250 Hz and the scope can sample them without aliasing and send them to the PC for plotting in the Arduino IDE.
